I have made all of the rooms that were necessary, in particular, I created the room known rainbow land, made a backroom closet and made all of the proper linkages, as well as made descriptions and leave messages going from each room to the other.

I made the proper description for myself:
look at #14397
steven.glasford
a superhero but with the power to heal and even make their own armor
It is awake and looks alert.

I made a description for me room and its closet
look
Rainbowland
A beautiful land of peace and prosperity
Obvious exits are: anteroom and closet
look
Backroom
Filled with unhappy people
Obvious exits are: back

I also left @leave messages between the rooms
@leave anteroom is "You wander with delight back to the anteroom"
You set the "leave" message of anteroom (#14457).
@leave rainbow is "You enter the beautiful land of equality known as Rainbowland, full of people who love you, it is very bright and colorful."
You set the "leave" message of rainbow (#14456).
@dig closet,backroom "Backroom"
closet,backroom "Backroom" (#14463) created.
addmyexits
@leave back is "You leave the closet, your family and friends accept you and love you"
You set the "leave" message of back (#14466).
@leave closet is "You enter the closet and feel depressed you can't reveal your true identity, nor can you love who you love, you are depressed and want to get out of the closet"
You set the "leave" message of closet (#14465).

Here is the raw transcript of the work I did

help @dig
Syntax:  @dig "<new-room-name>"
         @dig <exit-spec> to "<new-room-name>"
         @dig <exit-spec> to <old-room-object-number>

This is the basic building tool.  The first form of the command creates a new room with the given name.  The new room is not connected to anywhere else; it is floating in limbo.  The @dig command tells you its object number, though, so you can use the @move command to get there easily.

The second form of the command not only creates the room, but one or two exits linking your current location to (and possibly from) the new room.  An <exit-spec> has one of the following two forms:
        <names>
        <names>|<names>
where the first form is used when you only want to create one exit, from your current room to the new room, and the second form when you also want an exit back, from the new room to your current room.  In any case, the <names> piece is just a list of names for the exit, separated by commas; these are the names of the commands players can type to use the exit.  It is usually a good idea to include explicitly the standard abbreviations for direction names (e.g., 'n' for 'north', 'se' for 'southeast', etc.).  DO NOT put spaces in the names of exits; they are useless in MOO.

The third form of the command is just like the second form except that no new room is created; you instead specify by object number the other room to/from which the new exits will connect.

NOTE: You must own the room at one end or the other of the exits you create.  If you own both, everything is hunky-dorey.  If you own only one end, then after creating the exits you should write down their object numbers.  You must then get the owner of the other room to use @add-exit and @add-entrance to link your new exits to their room.

Examples:
    @dig "The Conservatory"
creates a new room named "The Conservatory" and prints out its object number.
    @dig north,n to "The North Pole"
creates a new room and also an exit linking the player's current location to the new room; players would say either 'north' or 'n' to get from here to the new room.  No way to get back from that room is created.
    @dig west,w|east,e,out to "The Department of Auto-Musicology"
creates a new room and two exits, one taking players from here to the new room (via the commands 'west' or 'w') and one taking them from the new room to here (via 'east', 'e', or 'out').
    @dig up,u to #7164
creates an exit leading from the player's current room to #7164, which must be an existing room.

help messages
Most objects have messages that are printed when a player succeeds or fails in manipulating the object in some way.  Of course, the kinds of messages printed are specific to the kinds of manipulations and those, in turn, are specific to the kind of object.  Regardless of the kind of object, though, there is a uniform means for listing the kinds of messages that can be set and then for setting them.

The '@messages' command prints out all of the messages you can set on any object you own.  Type 'help @messages' for details.

To set a particular message on one of your objects use a command with this form:
        @<message-name> <object> is "<message>"
where '<message-name>' is the name of the message being set, <object> is the name or number of the object on which you want to set that message, and <message> is the actual text.

For example, consider the 'leave' message on an exit; it is printed to a player when they successfully use the exit to leave a room.  To set the 'leave' message on the exit 'north' from the current room, use the command
        @leave north is "You wander in a northerly way out of the room."

[Note to programmers: This class of commands automatically applies to any property whose name ends in '_msg'.  Thus, in the example above, the command is setting the 'leave_msg' property of the named exit.  You can get such a command to work on new kinds of objects simply by giving the appropriate properties names that end in '_msg'.  Additionally, in many cases the _msg property is accompanied by a _msg verb, which defaultly returns the named property, but which is available to be customized in more complex ways than allowed by simple string substitution.  You should check for the particular property you're considering whether the verb form exists (typically with @list).]

The following help topics describe the uses of the various messages available on standard kinds of objects:

container-messages -- the messages on objects that can contain other objects
exit-messages -- the messages on exit objects
thing-messages -- the messages on objects that can be taken and dropped
@leave anteroom is "You wander with delight back to the anteroom"
You set the "leave" message of anteroom (#14457).

help @dig
Syntax:  @dig "<new-room-name>"
         @dig <exit-spec> to "<new-room-name>"
         @dig <exit-spec> to <old-room-object-number>

This is the basic building tool.  The first form of the command creates a new room with the given name.  The new room is not connected to anywhere else; it is floating in limbo.  The @dig command tells you its object number, though, so you can use the @move command to get there easily.

The second form of the command not only creates the room, but one or two exits linking your current location to (and possibly from) the new room.  An <exit-spec> has one of the following two forms:
        <names>
        <names>|<names>
where the first form is used when you only want to create one exit, from your current room to the new room, and the second form when you also want an exit back, from the new room to your current room.  In any case, the <names> piece is just a list of names for the exit, separated by commas; these are the names of the commands players can type to use the exit.  It is usually a good idea to include explicitly the standard abbreviations for direction names (e.g., 'n' for 'north', 'se' for 'southeast', etc.).  DO NOT put spaces in the names of exits; they are useless in MOO.

The third form of the command is just like the second form except that no new room is created; you instead specify by object number the other room to/from which the new exits will connect.

NOTE: You must own the room at one end or the other of the exits you create.  If you own both, everything is hunky-dorey.  If you own only one end, then after creating the exits you should write down their object numbers.  You must then get the owner of the other room to use @add-exit and @add-entrance to link your new exits to their room.

Examples:
    @dig "The Conservatory"
creates a new room named "The Conservatory" and prints out its object number.
    @dig north,n to "The North Pole"
creates a new room and also an exit linking the player's current location to the new room; players would say either 'north' or 'n' to get from here to the new room.  No way to get back from that room is created.
    @dig west,w|east,e,out to "The Department of Auto-Musicology"
creates a new room and two exits, one taking players from here to the new room (via the commands 'west' or 'w') and one taking them from the new room to here (via 'east', 'e', or 'out').
    @dig up,u to #7164
creates an exit leading from the player's current room to #7164, which must be an existing room.
